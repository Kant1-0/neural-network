# neural-network
(Only for educational purporse) C++ Project that can build a simple multi layer Neural Network able to handle XOR logic problem: an non linear classification problem. It uses a supervised learning, actually a Back Propagation training methods that tells where to seek the needle according to a set of training comparing Expected Outputs and Actual Outputs that gets a "Layer Error". It's the usual form of a Neural Network. Now working on Genetic Algorithm to create a reinforcement training that could be less efficient than a back propagation learning but would better handle others problems like solving sudoko, or optimizing space in a backpack.
